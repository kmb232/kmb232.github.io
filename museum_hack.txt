Bachelorette Party in NYC
We love hosting classy Bachelorette Parties in Manhattan at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Bachelorette Parties

Let’s chat and brainstorm something fun for your party.

Email us today at info@museumhack.com or call +1-844-218-1655 to book your party adventure.
What Will We See?

Your private tour guides will playfully guide you through the 2.3 million square feet and 270,000 works of art to reshape how you view the most intriguing and the most overlooked pieces at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Each tour is different and customized on the fly based on your private party. On most tours, we will visit the Temple of Dendur, the American Wing, Musical Instruments, Modern and Contemporary Galleries, and Asian Galleries, to name a few. Guides are also always happy to take requests ahead of time to guarantee a magical evening for the bride-to-be.

What's Different About A Bachelorette Party?

More wine, basically.

Your guide will show you the other side of some of the Museum’s heavy hitters. If you visit a Met highlight, you’re going to get the saucy backstory. We can customize the entire evening for you and your group to highlight your favorites, or show you new areas of the Museum that you may have never seen before.

Want to pre-game with red wine in a beautiful courtyard of the American Wing and then hear us rap about the most awesome Italian artist from the 16th Century?

No Problem.

Prefer Butts? Yes, we got butts!
Bachelorette Parties

The Metropolitan Museum of Butts is a new thematic tour offering that we can debut for your Bachelorette Party in NYC. This tour focuses on over 6000 years of butt history and looks at the enormity of the Met’s collection through the lens of butts and all things butt-related.

    An 18th Century Armchair / Toilet Hybrid
    A 6,000 Year-old Big Booty Princess
    LOTS and LOTS of Greek and Roman booty
    The ONLY sex scene in the Greek and Roman collection on display
    At least one donkey, and maybe a dog bed

People love to party with us:
The Knot

We can’t think of anything more chic and mysterious than touring the Met with your bridesmaids and hearing fun and raunchy stories — with wine pit stops at the Met’s cafe.

My girlfriends and I planned a bachelorette party with Museum Hack and we were not disappointed. We were able to have a fun, classy, but super silly evening with our VIP tour guides who pulled out all the (wine) stops to show us a fantastic time. The group was mixed between art/history buffs and Met noobs, and every single one of us enjoyed it to the FULLEST. I would definitely recommend booking a tour with this company if you’re ever looking for something classically New York while tremendously unique!

What our customers are saying:
Google

I heard about this group from a Googler on the Creative Lab team, who had recently taken a Museum Hack tour at The Met with her team and RAVED about it. I now understand why. I took my team this week as I felt we were over-indexing on work and under-indexing on fun.
Julie R., Head of Industry for Google, Inc.

Thank you for an absolutely exquisite morning on yesterday’s Museum Hack tour. Everyone really enjoyed it and it was all we could talk about afterwards. It was a truly joyful, inspiring, enlightening and FUN experience. Thanks so very much.
