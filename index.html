    <p>You asked for a link to my work. Since I didn't have such a place, I thought a brief online introduction to who I am and what I've done would be in order. <br>
    What can I bring to the table? Knowledge of digital communications, development, and data analysis, for starters. But I also know what it takes to motivate a team and keep projects on track. I have a strong sense of pride in my work and community and try to make sure those around me feel the same. Read on to find out more.

  <h2>Digital</h2>
  <p>Technology is all about finding the right tool for the job, and creating the tool if you can't find the one you want. I've planned an entire digital strategy and consulted on many others, created site and content, and learned to code. I understand the entire pipeline, from back end development to getting the wording just right. </p>

  <div id="topic">
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>Lots of people talk about big data, but I've actually worked with it and understand hte concepts. I fine-tuned a social media analytics program in order to help a variety of organizations get their message out, including what wording was popular and the demographics of their followers. I won't throw around numbers to sound impressive, though. Data analysis only works when you provide something that can be acted on.

    <h2>Organizing</h2>
    <p>My heart will always be in organizing. Everything else I do, communications or coding, is in the hope of working with others to improve our world. Community organizing is where I've gained the widest experience including event planning, fundraising, and project management.<br>Most importantly by organizing and managing volunteers I've learned the importance of teamwork and making sure everyone feels ownership in the project. It's a philosophy I work to encourage in my professional life, as well.

    <h2>International Experience</h2>
    <p>You learn a lot about yourself and your world when you pack up and move to a foreign country. My experience abroad has taught me how to work with people from all over the world and how to use creative thinking to solve any problem that comes my way. I've worked with professional and government organizations all over the world and know a thing or two about international communications.

      <a name="AboutMe"</a> 
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm originally from Indiana and can appreciate a county fair, but I eventually moved to Germany to study, work, and experience a new culture. Along the way I earned a B.A. in History, learned two foreign languages, done a bit of programming programming, and eventually ended up in Washington, D.C.<br>
    I want to make sure what I do matters and I want to encourage others to persue the same goal. I've taken the proverbial long and winding road, but it's given me a sense of purpose and a desire to push the limits of what is possible.
