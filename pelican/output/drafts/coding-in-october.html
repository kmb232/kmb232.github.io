              <p>I've been learning how to code for a while, but I still don't feel entirely <em>fluent</em>. Sure I've taken classes, workshops, online courses, you name it. I've built websites and done my own data collection and analysis. But I still feel like programming doesn't come naturally to me. I just don't do it regularly enough You forget so much if you put things aside that it can be a real challenge to start back up again. Programming just isn't a habit with me yet. To get over this I've decided to take inspiration from National Novel Writing Month and challenge myself to code every day in the month of October. It's the best way to make things like working with the command line and starting applications from scratch second nature.</p>
<p>The important thing with something like this is managing expectations. I know I'm not very likely to spend, say, an hour each day at my computer. I also know I tend to get bored/distracted if I try to work on one specific project for a while. Thus I've come up with the simple idea of just being sure to write a few lines of code each day. The emphasis isn't on quantity, it's on quality and mastering programming by keeping everything fresh in my brain. (I once compared learning programming with becoming fluent in a foreign language. You can read that <a href="http://kmb232.github.io/pelican/output/intro-on-language-learning.html">here</a>)</p>
<p>I don't have a definite plan for what this will entail. There are a couple of biger projects I want to work on, but I also want to take some time to do assorted exercises just to try new things. I may do some online courses to help me learn a new language. What's important is making coding a habit and gain more fluency in programming. It's a self-made immersive program.</p>
<p>I decided to share it online for two major reasons. First, I'm much more likely to stick to my goal if more people know about it and ask about it. Avoiding shame is a pretty strong driving force, especially if you've written an optimistic blog post for all the world to see. </p>
<p>But I'd also like to encourage others to join in. If you're new to programming, there are tons of resources out there to help you get started. Even if all you do in a day is figure out how to print "Hello World", remember that at least you're doing something. And if you're an experienced programmer, take the opportunity to learn a new language or work on a project you've been putting off. The idea of coding every day might not seem as helpful to you since you're already at work 8 hours a day during the week and probably working on open souce on the weekends, but I'm sure there's something you've been meaning to do but not devoting enough time to. I'm doing this in the spirit of learning and pushing past my comfort zone. If that sounds like something you want to spend a month doing, go for it. </p>
