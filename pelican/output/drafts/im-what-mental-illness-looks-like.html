            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>I once went 24 hours without drinking water. I did it to myself - I was so depressed that the necessary act of ingesting water seemed like more than I deserved.</p>
<p>I've had problems with mental health my entire life. I was 16 when I had my first depressive episode. I broke down crying in my English class and the teacher sent me down to see the school psychiatrist. I just remember her asking if I wanted to hurt myself and my only answer being, "I don't know."</p>
<p>I'm not the usual type of person who gets to speak publicly about mental health. We've become accustomed to celebrities and intellectuals talking about their problems - I admire people like Wil Wheaton for speaking out, and some of the comics on the subject have been great - but they can only accomplish so much. Yes, writers and actors get to talk about it, but what about the average person?</p>
<p>The average person has to worry about what the HR person at the office will think if they ask about insurance coverage for mental health. The average person hides their perscriptions in case someone sees them. The average person is paying ridiculous amounts of money for treatment because mental health isn't considered standard in most health plans.</p>
<p>Sure, there's a shorthand that exists. There's quite a few people I know who post routinely about mental health awareness who I'm pretty sure only do so because they've faced their own problems. We've been able to open up about depression and anxiety, as well. But there's still a long way to go. Those posts, and even admitting to depression and anxiety, cover a range of conditions and struggles that still remain taboo.</p>
<p>So I'll start. I have an endocrine disorder that makes me more prone to anxiety &amp; depression. My worst bouts of depression have been the result of bad reactions to hormonal birth control. I've been diagnosed ADD, I've had doctors wonder if I might be bipolar, and I know from experience that any one of these things can be linked to previous trauma.</p>
<p>But about a year and a half ago I made a decision that I was going to do something about it. I was extremely lucky to find great professionals to work with. Both my psychiatrist and therapist are amazing. Most importantly, I decided for once I was going to get over the guilt and shame of admitting that I needed long-term mental health care. I found a regime of medicines that works for me, and I feel like I can handle the world now.</p>
<p>Because with the proper care life can get better. Life is manageable. But we need to change our attitudes about it. It's not shameful to need drugs. Needing regular psychiatric care doesn't make you insane or less of a person. It's often the fear of what people might think and the guilt of feeling like a failure that makes people stop taking their medications. What we need instead is a society that encourages them.</p>
<p>Talking about mental health shouldn't be the preserve of writers and actors (who we've long talked about in such euphemisms as "temperamental" and who we almost idolize for their tragic stories). It's a problem we all face and we all should be able to talk about. And it's not that those who are suffering don't want to talk about it, but rather that they're convinced they can't without being told they need to "just get over it," or know that people will talk behind their back about how they "have issues."</p>
<p>As for me, well, there's a chance that one day someone will see this post and decide that I'm not worth hiring for a job because clearly I have "baggage." Well, so be it. I've shown time and time again that I'm smart and capable enough to do almost anything. If people want to criticize me for talking about it, I don't care. Because I'm what mental illness looks like, and I'm tired of feeling like it's a topic that needs to be hidden. No one should have to struggle alone.</p>
