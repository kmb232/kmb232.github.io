            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>I saw <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/10/09/why-do-more-u-s-women-study-abroad-than-men/?tid=sm_tw">this article</a> last week and it bothered me on several levels. I decided to write about it and had no idea where to start. The different education and career expecations for genders? How liberal arts are being taught? There's several issues involved here, all of which are very close to my heart and are topics I could write extensively on. But the main problem I kept returning to is this: Most, if not all, things that are preferred by women are considered frivolous by society. Is that really how we see study abroad, too?</p>
<p>It's only briefly mentioned in the article, but I think most of the reason for the gender disparity lies in the fact that boys are still encouraged to have careers more than girls. Girls are supposed to get educations, and they can have jobs, but they still don't have the same pressure to have a career that can support a family. Studying abroad ends up being like an extension of the 19th century idea that girls should be sent to finishing school in Europe to learn culture and refinement while the boys stayed at home to learn the family business or a valuable trade.</p>
<p>Part of it is also literary. Books and movies are filled with stories about girls who travel abroad and find love. Sometimes it's with a dashing prince, other times it's a foreigner of the tall-dark-and-handsome variety. Maybe it's just me (I certainly watched <em>Bridget Jones's Diary</em> far too often before I studied abroad dreaming of my own Darcy), and I don't want to suggest that all girls who study abroad have something so non-academic on their minds, but I do believe it's part of what's made studying abroad so heavily female over the years. It's a hard problem to fight since it can be traced all the way back to the Disney movies we watched as kids, but I like the think society is starting to be aware of it and make some progress.</p>
<p>Studying abroad is also getting easier. In an effort to get more students to study abroad colleges are offering more semester and summer programs, many of which include internships or volunteer opportunities and require no foreign language skill. These programs, which lack some of the traditional challenges of a junior year abroad, are seen as frivolous even by those who did study abroad. But it's these programs, which offer concrete career advancement and are least likely to cause problems with degree progress, that are the most popular with boys. And really, that's OK. I'm a big believer that any study abroad is better than none at all.</p>
<p>Overall it's the underlying idea that studying abroad isn't a serious endeavor that bothers me the most. I can't deny the fact that it's often a financial luxury for students, but it's definitely a major challenge for anyone who is lucky enough to be able to go. You may drink and flirt too much and not study enough, but you come back a better person. And even if no one takes studying abroad seriously on your resume, the skills in problem solving, multicultural communications, and confidence will pay off in spades throughout your career. </p>
<p>Because no matter who you are or where you're studying, there's always going to be that first night when you find yourself in a small room on a small bed, missing key items and not knowing how to get them in your new location, possibly hungry because you didn't know what to order from the menu, tired from jetlag, and scared to death of what you've gotten yourself into. It's a universal experience, and one that should be encouraged and supported for as many students as possible as an important part of a college education.</p>
