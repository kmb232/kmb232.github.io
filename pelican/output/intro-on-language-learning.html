            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>For my first post I wanted to talk about something near and dear to my heart, language learning. I’ve learned approximately five languages in my life, if you lump human and computer languages together. Having done both I can tell you that the processes are actually quite similar, especially in two important ways. You have to be prepared to feel like an idiot, but despite that you have to dive in and try.</p>
<p>I take pride in my sarcasm and sense of humor, and any time I’ve learned a new foreign language I’ve felt like I was missing some key part of my personality. I use humor to connect to people but it’s hard to sound witty when you have the linguistic abilities of a five year old. And people laughing at your mistakes doesn’t really help. I had to swallow my pride and realize that I was going to sound stupid for a while, but the important thing was that I was learning a foreign language.</p>
<p>Likewise with code it can be difficult to feel so completely and utterly inept. About the 1,000th time some kind soul points out that your code isn’t running because you misplaced the semicolon it can be tempting to give up. But if you really want to learn to code, you learn to value the moments when you feel like you’re getting the hang of it and accept the moments when you don’t.</p>
<p>Because you will only truly learn if you immerse yourself and just keep trying. I had to move to two different countries before I was able to master their respective languages, and even then I often needed prodding to escape my comfortable English-language bubble. Now here I am, continuing my efforts to learn how to code. I don’t feel like an expert in any sense of the word yet (I still keep forgetting those damn semicolons), but I’ve started to see that with more practice things start to get easier.</p>
<p>These points may seem obvious to you, but we often forget how difficult it is to try something new. My goal in starting a blog is to try to remind people of this fact and share some of what I find helpful as I continue to learn. I may go on tangents about other topics occasionally, but I’m hoping to at the very least to inspire someone who’s feeling a bit discouraged to keep trying. It’s not easy, but if I can build a site and create a blog, eventually you can too, in whichever language you feel comfortable with.</p>
