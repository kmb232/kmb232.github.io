              <p>If you have a career, odds are you've had periods without a job. It's a time when you're supposed to be focused, organized, and take care of yourself - but those things are hard at the best of times when you have ADD. I struggled in my own time job hunting, but I also developed coping mechanisms. Maybe some of them will be useful to you.</p>
<p>Bonus: Lots of these are tips I've found helpful since I started freelancing a while back, too. Basically any time you don't have a set routing and constant deadlines to organize your day around. </p>
<p><strong>1. Be wary of procrastination</strong></p>
<p>Procrastination is a hallmark of ADD, but it can be your worst enemy when you're unemployed. It can be easy to put off small things (job applications) and even some of the larger ones (making sure you have health insurance). I always tended to procrastinate finding some kind of temp or part-time job, partly out of optimism that I'd find something soon but mostly because I just didn't feel like doing it that day. Be aware of how prone to it you may be, and force yourself to do the big things.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don't be a hero</strong></p>
<p>What I mean is, don't see skipping your meds as a way to save money. Do whatever it takes to make sure you don't have to change your medicine. Being unemployed is stressful, and you need every weapon in your arsenal to keep yourself together. You might not feel that bad, you might think that without a job you don't need to concentrate as much, but you do. Just don't risk it.</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep your social skills in practice</strong></p>
<p>I've worked hard in my life to make sure I can pay attention in conversations deal with my anxiety. The problem is that if I don't practice regularly it's like I have to relearn everything. Go to meetups, see friends, and get involved in your community so you don't lose all the hard work.</p>
<p><strong>4. Abuse your friends</strong></p>
<p>Hopefully you have a social circle who wants to help you out. Find as many people as you can who are willing to proofread your cover letters and make use of them. You can thank them with beer once you find a job, which you're more likely to do if your job applications aren't full of typos.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don't sit on the couch</strong></p>
<p>If you start your morning on the couch or have lunch there, one episode of Midsomer Murders can turn into several, and before you know it you've wasted your day. If you stay at a table or desk, however, it's easier to be productive. You automatically feel more like you're in work mode.</p>
<p><strong>6. Set up calendar alerts</strong></p>
<p>For important things (Doctor's appointments, interviews) add alerts when you create the event. I suggest 2 hours because that gives me enough time to get across town if I need to. Without a job you're probably not checking your calendar regularly, and this helps make sure you don't miss anything.</p>
<p><strong>7. Save all the files related to a job application in one folder</strong></p>
<p>I have a folder in Documents for job-hunting. In that folder are individual subfolders for every single job I've applied for. I make sure to save a copy of my resume and the cover letter there, as well as any associated materials. That way I'm relatively certain that the resume I'm sending is the one tailored for that job and the file MyName_CoverLetter.doc isn't for the wrong company.</p>
<p><strong>8. Send networking emails immediately</strong></p>
<p>If you happen to connect with someone, send them an email or add them on LinkedIn immediately. I've lost several business cards and other slips of paper before I've had a chance to actually contact them.</p>
<p><strong>9. You've heard it before, exercise</strong></p>
<p>What I said about needing every weapon you have? Make exercise one of them. It's proven to be a great way for helping to control ADD, helping to improve your mood and concentration. It's also a great way to add some routine to your day if you go running in the morning or make yourself go to the gym in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>10. Keep track of the jobs you're interested in</strong></p>
<p>Slightly shameless plug, but a friend of mine built a <a href="hunt-is-on.herokuapp.com">great site</a> for keeping track of the jobs you've found and applied for. Even if it doesn't work for you, find a way to keep track of the jobs you like so you don't neglect to actually apply for something that sounded good. </p>
<p><strong>11. Figure out where you work best</strong></p>
<p>Some people might do better working at home without distractions, others might prefer a coffee shop or the local library. Personally I've done best when I mix it up a bit. Also, check out local coworking spaces, if you can. Some of them are pretty reasonable and provide great places to get work done.</p>
<p><strong>12. Leave with your roommates/partner in the morning</strong></p>
<p>"Get into a routine" is a classic piece of advice for the unemployed, but it's cloe to impossible with ADD. If you live with someone else, make yourself get up and leave the house when they do. It doesn't matter where you go, just getting out will enforce some routine in your day and help make you more productive.</p>
<p><strong>13. Take your interview clothes to the dry cleaner immediately</strong></p>
<p>This is a special step in watching your procrastination. If you have something to wear to an interview that's clean, freshly pressed, and tailored, it's one less thing you need to worry about when sudden interviews come up.</p>
<p><strong>14. Don't use Google Docs</strong></p>
<p>I love Google Docs as much as the next person, but when I need to really get work done it's better to break out trusty Microsoft Word in order to avoid getting distracted by tabs with new emails or Facebook notifications. If you don't have Word try a simple text editor like Sublime Text or the $12 app Byword.</p>
<p><strong>15. Try blocking your time</strong></p>
<p>Traditional to-do lists aren't very helpful when you really have only one item on the list - find a job. It's helpful to instead think in terms of blocks of time. Say, "I'll look for jobs for 45 minutes, and then I want to spend another 45 minutes on that Coursera class." That way you stay productive without being obsessed with any specific tasks.</p>
<p><strong>16. Sign up for email alerts about job postings</strong></p>
<p>Browsing job sites can be a waste of time, especially if your ability to focus is at a premium. Sign up for email alerts about job postings from career sites. You get a concise list that you can go through in a few minutes rather than spending hours searching.</p>
<p>Above all else, remember to be kind to yourself. It's hard at the best of times, and it doesn't help when you feel like you're fighting against yourself as well as the rest of the world. Don't be too hard on yourself if you spend a whole day on Twitter occasionally or you forget to do laundry on a regular basis. Make time for the things you enjoy, keep yourself healthy, and most importantly keep going. </p>
