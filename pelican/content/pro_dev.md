Title: No, I Don't Want to Be a Professional Developer

I know how to code, yes. I want to continue to learn how to code. But I've noticed a problem with most coding classes and online tutorials. I'm not looking for a career change. I don't want to be a professional developer, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be a place for me and people like me in the wider tech community. We need more people who are code-conversant.

The average company or organization has dozens of small things that can be improved with fairly simple code. In my current office some of the tasks I've automated include web scraping, html editing, and data analysis. I've taught my colleages how to run a script fromt he command line and saved us probably hundreds of hours of work in the past two years, yet I wasn't hired to be a developer.

Better communication and improved teamwork can also be helped by having more programmers around, whatever their level. When non-technical departments work with contractors or in-house developers, some knowledge of how technology works can be invaluable in avoiding crossed signals and making sure everyone leaves a meeting happy. As I've moved into product this is a skill that's become even more important, but the same applies to marketing, customer success, or any other department.   

Even in non-technical fields coding should be seen as a major bonus and not just an irrelevant skill. Odds are someone who's mastered programming will be quicker to learn any other new skills and will have better problem-solving abilities. Learning to code forces you to strip any issue down to its basic components and build a solution from there. It's a process that can be applied in any number of areas.

But on a personal level, please stop asking me if I want to be a developer. While tech can be a warm and welcoming place, there can sometimes be an emphasis on learning to code to completely change your career. Too many people feel like it's a skill only worth learning if they intend to be a full-time developer. Nope, I'm proud to say that I don't want to be a professional developer, and I like to think the world would be a better place if there were more people like me.
