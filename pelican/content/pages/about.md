Title: About
Authors: Kathleen Burnett


A blank "about" page on a blog can be a very daunting thing. I'm supposed to say something exciting enough about myself or what I'm writing that will make you want to stick around.

The truth is I'm a sometimes programmer, sometimes digital communications specialist, oftentimes traveler, always curious individual who wanted to take on the challenge of maintaining a site and keeping up with a blog that doesn't make use of WordPress or some such CMS.

Ideally I'll share something about technology, art, or some such topic that will be of interest to a few people. If you happen upon something that you in fact find interesting, please let me know!
