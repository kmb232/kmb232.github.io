Title: MaxDiff Analysis in an Existing Product

I recently completed a user study using MaxDiff analysis. If you're not familair with it, MaxDiff is a method of conducing a survey where respondents are asked to choose what features of a list they consider most important to them and least important, and then aggregating that data across all combinations and all your respondants. I won't get into the statistical background of such a survey, but I encourage you to do a little research on the subject if you're so inclined.

We did another survey on the product recently, so why do another now? The previous survey had taken a more traditional "How important do you think the following items are? - Very, somewhat, not very, or not at all?" Hey, I get it. We all like to have our users tell us that everything we do is important and make us feel special. But allowing everything to be rated highly isn't entirely useful. How do you make actual decisions about new features or a rebuild based on that? I hated my freshman econ classes, but the one thing I remember is that scarcity is a thing. You'll have to make decisions about your resource allocation at some point in time, and you need data to help you make those decisions.

Frequently Max-Diff is seen as a valuable tool for developing entirely new products, but in this case we were working with a well-established research database. In my opinion max-diff works even better in such a situation because users can speak from their own experience instead of hypotheticals about what they like in this type of product. With an existing product it can also be easy to look at your usage statistics and equate 'frequency' with 'importance'. But when we completed our survey we found that many less-frequently used features were rated as very important by our users. Specifically, we have a redundant feature that also exists on our main website, and is accessed rather infrequently, but users rated it extremely important to have it available in the database.

*The pink bar above is actually our second most popular figure according to our analytics. People use it, but it's not as important to them. We need to make sure it's easily accesible, but don't need to focus our development energy on improving it.*

Equally surprising were some of the features that were marked "least important." We had previously assumed improving the mobile experience should be our number one priority, but it turns out users just aren't that interested. It stands to reason -- most people do research while sitting at their desk an dnot from their phone -- but it was a genuine surprise. The reason for this is that we've had some users vocally complain about the mobile experience and ask us to improve it, and while we appreciate any user feedback, max-diff allowed us to get a better view across our user base. 

The one downside to using max-diff with an existing product is that it can agitate your users. We received comments to the effect of, "How can I honestly say that X is more important than Y? I need both!" Some users were even afraid features marked least important would disappear entirely. These were infrequent comments, however. Well-written explanatory text in your survey can go a long way to mitigating some of this. It's also a good idea to make it easy for respondants to contact someone with questions or concerns.

What we realized though all this was that our basic understanding of user behavior was wrong. Even the complaints we received helped us reach our ultimate conclusion -- a research database is valuable for providing access to obscure resources people don't use that often as much as it's a good place to find the resources you use on a daily basis. We had been so caught up with the resources the usage data told us were important we didn't stop to look at the entire product holistically. Now that we know what really matters to our users, we can really fine-tune our user experience with these lessons in mind.
