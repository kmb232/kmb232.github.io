There's a strange disconnect in the world today. We're convinced that science is the answer. Science will solve our problems. Science is the way, the truth. STEM as being pushed as the great new movement we need in our schools because we think those are the fields that are going to make all the difference to socity in the future. 

I take the title of this blog post from the popular Facebook page that is frequently shared and cited as an example of how cool science has become. It used to be the domain of eggheads, but now it's for everyone! Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson are cultural celebrities the way famous authors used to be. And that's great, anything that makes people more curious about the world is a good thing.

But look at the problems our world is facing - inequality, institutional racism, religious intolerance - these aren't problems that can be solved by science. We can't begin to understand the Middle East without knowing something of the region's history. We can't think about how race as impacted the United States without taking the time to read the works of African-American authors. Science may be fashionable right now, but we're still humans and our worldview is lacking if we completely ignore the humanities. 

Now I'm definitely not the first person to point this out. But I have a novel solution. What if we made it cool just to be curious in the world around us? What if we had a rockstar museum curator to go along with the rockstar scientists? What I'm trying to say is that there's no reason to hold onto the ridiculous idea we develop in school that we're either math & science people or humanities people. Being a responsible citizen of the world requires us to be curious about all parts of the world around us and open to all new ideas.

As I point in the title, you don't have to "fucking love science." You just have to be open to the idea that the world is a bigger, more complicated, but more amazing place than any of us can fully comprehend. You have to be willing to open your mind. Go read a book, or visit a local art museum. Take time to think about not just the natural world but what it means to be human. You'll be a much better person.
