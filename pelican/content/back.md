Title: Where Are All the Leisure Swimmers?

My boyfriend & I have recently started swimming at least once per week at a local pool. It's great exercise that we can enjoy together. But I'm not an expert. Most of my technique was learned during an elective I took in college called "Swimming for the Nonswimmer." To this day I stick to a basic, easy breast stroke most of the time. I'm not training for any races.

I went swimming fairly often when I lived in Germany, too. Public pools were convenient and well-maintained. They also had one thing going for them that I have yet to find in the US: they were the domain of leisure swimmers, people who saw swimming as good exercise and nothing more. People of all ages would come to get a bit of exercise year-round. Some pools even did without lanes, but people would still be doing their laps at whatever pace they wanted.

Here in DC leisure and slower swimmers are limited in how much of the pool they can use, and even there the pace is pretty brisk. Most people seem to be former high school swimmers who still think coach is going to care what their best lap time was at the end. Not that I feel these people shouldn't use the pool, but I think they're a symptom of something fundamentally wrong with the US.

All too often we can't take part in an activity without feeling the need to overdo it. Think about how many people you know who have decided to train for a marathon, for example. It's not enough to simply want to go for a jog every so often to stay healthy. Gentle, relaxing yoga has been replaced by intense flow classes. Even dieting has to be no-gluten, all-organic instead of just skipping dessert now and then.

We need more of an emphasis on moderation. People need to know that it's ok to be a beginner and even stay a beginner. All swimmers should feel welcome regardless of speed or skill level. Exercise in all forms should be a chance to relax and stay healthy, not an outlet for some endless desire to one-up our neighbors. No one gets a medal, but we all end up with a better quality of life.
