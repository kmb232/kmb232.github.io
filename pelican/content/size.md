Title: Why Generations?

"Baby Boomers" as an entity weren't discussed until the 1980's, at least that's what my research on Google Books' Ngram Viewer and Chronicle from the New York Times shows. I spent some time looking at the use of terms for various generations and it's lead me to one conclusion: the emphasis on social generations, and especially the current obsession with Millennials, is past its utility.

> We [sic] had the toughest time getting into college. When we got in, many were denied financial aid because the available funding could not keep pace with the influx.

> When we entered the job market, we were forced to drive cabs and become secretaries because, despite our B.A.'s M.A.'s and Ph.D.'s, there were too many applicants and too few jobs. Many of us who have made it into the work force - and are footing the bill for the bulk of many programs such as Social Security - are now told that by the time we reach eligibility the money will run out. Now the front door to the housing market slams in our face. Yes, we do have dashed expectations, and yes, we do appreciate the finer things in life and are reluctant to give up ''small amenities'' - especially decent housing, good schools, the right to provide for our children what our parents provided for us. 

If you read that closely, you'll notice there isn't talk about repaying student loans and "taxi drivers" is mentioned instead of "barista" as a generic low-paying job. That's because it was published in the New York Times in July of 1981. I omitted how the author spoke of "We baby boomers" in order to highlight how redundant the coverage of succeeding generations has become. Millennials aren't a completely different species, but you wouldn't think that given the coverage of them.

One of the criticisms most often levied against the study of social generations is that it doesn't pay attention to other shaping factors such as race, gender, or class. Social generations serve as a way of describing white, middle-to-upper class individuals. As we struggle to address the problems our nation has with race, gender, and wealth distribution perhaps a good starting point would be to stop using age-based generations as a way of defining the privileged as normal. While its true the 1960s saw major steps forward in civil rights, and fighting in Vietnam was by no means limited to the elites, the defining image of Baby Boomer is still the white kid taking part in a student protest in the 1960s*. Today America is more diverse than ever, so why are we holding up the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Lena Dunham as the defining examples of their generation?

Yes, there was a large number of children born following World War II. That was how the Baby Boomers were defined, just as now Millennials are defined by how they grew up online. Generation X? They were abandoned as soon as the internet replaced MTV as the dominant force corrupting the youth. It's one thing for marketers to look at the 18-35 demographic or for historians to analyze how society changed 50 years after the fact, but otherwise it's time to give our insistance in looking at generations a rest. They're malleable, they facing similar problems at similar stages of life, and there are far better issues to discuss.
