> We [redacted] had the toughest time getting into college. When we got in, many were denied financial aid because the available funding could not keep pace with the influx.

> When we entered the job market, we were forced to drive cabs and become secretaries because, despite our B.A.'s M.A.'s and Ph.D.'s, there were too many applicants and too few jobs. Many of us who have made it into the work force - and are footing the bill for the bulk of many programs such as Social Security - are now told that by the time we reach eligibility the money will run out. Now the front door to the housing market slams in our face. Yes, we do have dashed expectations, and yes, we do appreciate the finer things in life and are reluctant to give up ''small amenities'' - especially decent housing, good schools, the right to provide for our children what our parents provided for us. 

That was published in the New York Times in July of 1981. I omitted how the author started with "We baby boomers", but otherwise it's amazingly similar to what young people have been saying for years. Recently the emphasis has been on Millennials but they aren't acompletely different species. It's just part of a trend that was started over 30 years ago by Baby Boomers trying to highlight the unique struggles they were facing.

"Baby Boomers" as an entity weren't discussed until the late 1970s, at least that's what my research on Google Books' Ngram Viewer and Chronicle from the New York Times shows. I spent some time looking at the use of terms for various generations and it's lead me to one conclusion: the emphasis on social generations, and especially the current obsession with Millennials, is past its utility.

Discussion of specific generations like the Baby Boomers really started peaking once they were old enough to be doing the writing. Coversely mentions of Generation X and Millennials occured as these groups were reaching adulthood. The New York Times data shows a similar trajectory. ([Click here to see the NYTimes Data](http://chronicle.nytlabs.com/?keyword=millennials.generation%20y.baby%20boomers.generation%20x&format=count)) We like the idea of fixed generations because being able to talk about homogenous groups simplifies things, but there are always new people turning 21 or 30. And children will always be different from their parents. 

The paradigm created by Baby Boomers just doesn't work in the real world. It's much easier to define a generation after the fact, when it's easy to point out events which shaped the coming of age of a group of people such as the Vietnam War. Generation X was lacking in such moments and so they have slipped into obscurity. There's also the problem that much discussion of generations focuses on the experiences of the majority population. Many Baby Boomers had lives that were remarkably similar to their parents' and never stepped foot near a student protest nor went to Vietnam. 

It is true that there are more Americans between roughly the ages of 15 and 33 than any other age group, but good luck convincing them that they are a homogenous entity. In fact [the press release from the U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-113.html) focuses on how they're the most racially diverse age group the U.S. has ever had.  Such diversity creates a conflict in trying to define what the average "Millennial" is like, especially since a strong aversion to being defined by the majority narrative is becoming increasingly common in people under 30.

Racial diversity isn't the only problem. The concept of individual identity has changed dramatically over the last several years. Age has been eclipsed by race, gender, and sexual orientation as an individual's means of identifying themselves. Technology has enabled previously marginalized groups to find each other and form their own groups regardless of how old they are.

The current vogue for articles on Millennials is part of the longstanding tradition of pinning society's changes on young people, but it shouldn't be seen as dogma that there are individual generations to discuss. Society is constantly evolving, and relying on an idea that emerged only in the 1980s to describe one specific group isn't doing anyone any favors. Talk about "18-35's", talk about how populations in cities, marriage rates, or any other demographic is changing, just stop talking about Millennials. There's no such thing.
