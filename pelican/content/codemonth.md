Title: Coding in October

This all started with yarn. Yarn? Yarn. I was learning how to knit, and some of the best advice I encountered was to be sure to knit a few rows every day. It's the best way to make all the motions feel natural.

Fast forward to my continuous efforts to do more coding. I've taken several classes. I've attended various workshops and tried a few online lessons. I've learned a decent amount about computers, but I still feel like I have progress to be made internalizing how code works. So I've decided to take a piece of advice about knitting (with a little inspiration from National Novel Writing Month) and focus on improving my programming skills by spending the month of October making sure I do at least *some* coding every day.

The important thing with something like this is managing expectations. I know I'm not very likely to spend, say, an hour each day at my computer. I also know I tend to get bored/distracted if I try to work on one specific project for a while. Thus I've come up with the simple idea of just being sure to write a few lines of code each day. The emphasis isn't on quantity, it's on quality and mastering programming. (I once compared learning programming with becoming fluent in a foreign language. You can read that [here](http://kmb232.github.io/pelican/output/intro-on-language-learning.html))

I don't have a definite plan for what this will entail. There are a couple of biger projects I want to work on, but I also want to take some time to do assorted exercises just to try new things. I may do some online courses to help me learn a new language. What's important is making coding a habit and be able to write the simple things without much thought.

I decided to share it online for two major reasons. First, I'm much more likely to stick to my goal if more people know about it and ask about it. Shame is a pretty strong driving force, especially if you've written an optimistic blog post for all the world to see. 

But I'd also like to encourage others to join in. If you're new to programming, there are tons of resources out there to help you get started. If you're an experienced programmer, take the opportunity to learn a new language or work on a project you've been putting off. I'm doing this in the spirit of learning and pushing past my comfort zone. If that sounds like something you want to spend a month doing, go for it.
