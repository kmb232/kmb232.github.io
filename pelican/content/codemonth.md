Title: My Coding Goals in October

I've been learning how to code for a while, but I still don't feel entirely *fluent*. Sure I've taken classes, workshops, online courses, you name it. I've built websites and done my own data collection and analysis. But I still feel like programming doesn't come naturally to me. I just don't do it regularly enough, it's not quite a habit. You forget so much if you put things aside for a few days that it can be a real challenge to start back up again. To get over this I've decided to take inspiration from National Novel Writing Month and challenge myself to code every day in the month of October. I figure it would be the best way to really learn how to code.

The important thing with something like this is managing expectations. I know I'm not very likely to spend, say, an hour each day at my computer. I also know I tend to get bored/distracted if I try to work on one specific project for a while. Thus I've come up with the simple idea of just being sure to write a few lines of code each day. The emphasis isn't on quantity, it's on quality and mastering programming by keeping everything fresh in my brain. (I once compared learning programming with becoming fluent in a foreign language. You can read that [here](http://kmb232.github.io/pelican/output/intro-on-language-learning.html))

I don't have a definite plan for what this will entail. There are a couple of bigger projects I want to work on, but I also want to take some time to do assorted exercises just to try new things. I may do some online courses to help me learn a new language. What's important is trying to reach a point where the simple aspects of coding are easier so that I can move on to more complex problems. It's a self-made immersive program, only without the hefty fees.

I decided to share my plan for two major reasons. First, I'm much more likely to stick to my goal if more people know about it and ask about it. Avoiding shame is a pretty strong driving force, especially if you've written an optimistic blog post for all the world to see. 

But I'd also like to encourage others to join in. If you're new to programming, there are tons of resources out there to help you get started. Even if all you do in a day is figure out how to print "Hello World", remember that at least you're doing something. It could also be a great opportunity for experienced programmers. The idea of coding every day might not seem as helpful to you since you're already at work 8 hours a day during the week and probably working on open souce on the weekends, but I'm sure there's something you've been meaning to do but not devoting enough time to. The whole idea is about learning and pushing past your comfort zone. If that sounds like something you want to spend a month doing, go for it.
