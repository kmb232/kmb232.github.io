I read [this article](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9214015/tech-nerds-politics?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) this morning with great interest. As someone who has dipped her toes in both politics and tech I've seen first-hand how the two often struggle to understand one another. It's a great article that makes some valid points about what people in tech (and the general public, really) get wrong about our political system.

The general idea is that people in tech, referred to as nerds throughout the article, are all eagerly awaiting the rise of some moderate, non-partisan movement that will stop gridlock and make the world a better place. But the people in question aren't moderates. They span the full political spectrum of ideology, they're just not interested in politics in the traditional sense of the word. There's something almost imperalistic about the tech industry - backwards people should learn from their shining guiding light. Politcs, however, stubbornly refuses to bow to that.

True political activism involes things that tech people don't enjoy. Politics involves losing. No matter what side you're on, you will lose at some point in time. Tech has an emphasis on success, and even turning your failures into successes, that just won't work in the political climate. My developer boyfriend had this to say about it: "Politics is messy and not very rational (although political scientists put up a valiant fight) and smells very strong of popularity, which doesn’t appeal as much to nerds, so it’s dismissed."

Voting itself is not a technical endeavor. Campaigning, despite the headlines about Obama's use of data and the myriad of political posts you see on Facebook, is still profoundly low-tech. Individuals still have to sit down and make calls or go canvassing door to door to gain votes, and citizens must still go to their local polling place come elction day. Aside from a few pros working at campaign headquarters there is little opportunity to show off one's technical ability. The non-monetary currency of tech - influence and prestige amongst your peers - isn't often achieved in campaign field offices.

Tech also faces the problem every other minority has faced -- people are less likely to be involved if politicians don't reflect their identity. Of course when minorities have faced this problem they weren't in the privileged position of the predominately white male tech corps. They don't think middle-aged suits will "get" them. What they need to realize, however, is that a few billionaire donors won't change that. If they want more tech people running for office they'll have to start by getting involved in all levels of political activism - joining political parties, attending meetings, and turning out to vote.

And while youth is a large part of it, there's a special arrogance to tech. At a tech conference a few months ago I heard an exec from a major tech nonprofit say, "It's a rational decision now not to vote." The whole talk about how to improve the world yet the easiest and most low-tech way of doing just that was dismissed. I'd be more than happy for the tech community to prove me wrong, but I feel like as it stands we'll continue see more people talking about how tech can improve society and fewer people actually doing something about it.
