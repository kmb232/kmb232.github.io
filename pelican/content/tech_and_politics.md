I read [this article](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/27/9214015/tech-nerds-politics?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) this morning with great interest. As someone who has dipped her toes in both politics and tech I've seen first-hand how the two often struggle to understand one another. It's a great article that makes some valid points about what people in tech (and the general public, really) get wrong about our political system.

The general idea is that people in tech, referred to as nerds throughout the article, are all eagerly awaiting the rise of some moderate, non-partisan movement that will stop gridlock and make the world a better place. The author counters that those who consider themselves Independent voters are just as partisan as anyone else and that the moderates that are longed for really only serve corporate interests, but the tech community as a whole isn't short on ideology. The problem is that this ideology is coupled with tunnel vision and ego that prevents many in technology from being more involved in politics.

True political activism involes things that tech people don't enjoy. Politics involves losing. No matter what side you're on, you will lose at some point in time, often in the same election when you win. Tech has an emphasis on success, and even turning your failures into successes, that just won't work in the political climate. My developer-boyfriend had this to say about it: "Politics is messy and not very rational (although political scientists put up a valiant fight) and smells very strong of popularity, which doesn’t appeal as much to nerds, so it’s dismissed."

Voting itself is not a technical endeavor. Campaigning, despite the headlines about Obama's use of data and the myriad of political posts you see on Facebook, is still profoundly low-tech. Individuals still have to sit down and make calls or go canvassing door to door to gain votes. Aside from a few pros working at campaign headquarters there is little opportunity to show off one's technical ability. The non-monetary currency of tech - influence and prestige amongst your peers - isn't often achieved in campaign field offices.

Tech also faces the problem every other minority has faced -- people are less likely to be involved if politicians don't reflect their identity. Of course when minorities have faced this problem they weren't in the privileged position of the predominately white male tech corps. They don't think middle-aged suits will "get" them. What they need to realize, however, is that simply donating money won't change that. If they want more tech people running for office they'll have to start by getting involved in all levels of political activism - joining political parties, attending meetings, and turning out to vote.

It's all part of a dark side to tech that people within the community are sometimes loath to bring up. It's easy to point fingers at the extreme cases, such as startup founders in San Francisco complaining about homeless people, but it's more alarming in the way many in tech have convinced themselves that they're beyond politics. The old adage is that elections are decided by those who turn up is never more true, and what people in tech especially need to realize is that they have to take a step back and be a little old-fashioned or they'll be left out of key parts of society.
