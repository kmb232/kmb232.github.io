The new James Bond movie is coming out soon, and as usual the actresses involved have said in interviews that, "She's not the normal damsel-in-distress Bond Girl, she's strong and independent." It never fails. Of course they end up being just as helpless as all the others, but that's not what bothers me.

I don't like how they forget all the previous Bond girls who have indeed been independent. Take Pussy Galore, for example. The character went toe to toe with Goldfinger. There were the rival agents, able to fight just as well as Bond: Agent XXX in The Spy Who Loved Me, Wai Lin in Tomorrow Never Dies. Even Moneypenny could be a feminist icon - a smart career woman who seems to be the only person who can handle Bond himself.

So why do we have such little respect for these women? Why is being a Bond Girl synonymous only with the superficial? I'd like to put forth a theory. Bond Girls aren't allowed to sleep with Bond. Once they do, they no longer count as humans. We don't allow for one minute that maybe, just maybe, some women enjoy the chance to get busy with a ripped secret agent. The problem isn't that women are defenseless against guns, we judge them for being defenseless against James Bond himself.

Overall the Bond films are on the same level as most movies when it comes to how they portray women. They just have a bad rap because they expect us to get over the last great taboo - that women can enjoy sex. If society and the filmmakers could embrace that, we could start to see Bond films that are a lot more feminist than we give them credit for.
