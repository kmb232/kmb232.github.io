I saw [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2015/10/09/why-do-more-u-s-women-study-abroad-than-men/?tid=sm_tw) last week and it bothered me on several levels. I decided to write about it and had no idea where to start. The different education and career expecations for genders? How liberal arts are being forgotton? 

It's only briefly mentioned in the article, but I think most of the reason for the disparity lies in the fact that boys are still encouraged to have careers more than girls. Girls are supposed to get educations, and they can have jobs, but they still don't have the same pressure for career achievements.

Because studying abroad is seen as frivolous and not directly related to helping with one's career, it's considered something for girls.  It's an extension of the 19th century idea that girls should be sent to finishing school in Europe to learn culture and refinement while the boys stayed at home to learn the family business.

Colleges have tried to change this perception by offering programs that include internships and volunteer opportunities, but it's not much help.
