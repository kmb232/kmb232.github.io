With so many volunteer opportunities that exist for developers, how do you make the most of them? How do you do good without too much stress? As a programmer and a nonprofit professional I've been on both sides of the arrangement so I can give you a few tips on what nonprofits really appreciate and what will make your life as a volunteer better.

There are many reasons to volunteer to code something for a nonprofit. Obviously you want to give back to your community, but you may also want to work on a project outside of work, want some experience using a new library or language, or want a chance to network. These are all great! But those of us who work in nonprofits just want one thing -- a piece of technology *that we can use* to help us meet our mission in a specific way. Don't forget this when you're trying to help a nonprofit. 

The downside to this conflict of expectations is that often the onus to get things going falls on the developer. There's plenty of things you have to worry about because many nonprofit employees or volunteers just aren't going to be familiar with them. You don't just have to explain and be responsible for the technology itself, you have to be responsible for the development process, as well.

_Step 1: Do Your Research._

People in nonprofits are mission-driven. Understanding not just that but the specific mission of the nonprofit you're working with can greatly improve your working relationship. I'm not saying you have to become an expert, but 10 minutes on the organization's website or social media feed should be enough to give you a sense of their main goals and any current initiatives.

One benefit of doing a bit of research on the organization is that it gives you a chance to see if there's any terminology you should familiarize yourself with. I work in immigration and we have a tendency to talk in government acronyms. That's just one example, but there's many others. There might not even be any, but understanding these can make communicating with nonprofit professionals easier.

This leads me to a major point in all of this -- good communication is vital. Make sure you have some kind of intro meeting at the beginning of a project to be certain everyone is on the same page. You need to know exactly what they want to accomplish with the project. This is also your opportunity to find out what the technical knowledge of the nonprofit is. It's no good writing something that requires using the command line if no one even knows what it is.

_Step 2: Wear All the Hats._

In your office you're probably used to working with a product manager, a design team, front-end devs, back-end devs, etc. When doing a volunteer project there's a good chance you'll have to do all of the above. I'm not saying any of this has to get in the way of actually coding the project, but there's a few things you don't want to forget.

You want to start by defining for yourself the MVP you need to put together. This should roughly mirror the bare minimum the organization is loooking for in the prject. Once you've done this feel free to add whatever other features are asked for or may strike our fancy, but it's an important step to make sure neither you nor the nonprofit get ahead of themselves. If it's a longer project, you might also want to mentally divide things into "sprints," ideally with a short check-in between each one.

And if you're designing an interface of any kind, keep the basics of accesibility in mind. At the very least you can do a contrast check on your colors. University websites are also great places to find information on the basics of web accessibility. The same goes for user experience. You don't have to spend a ton of time making sure it's just right, but you should at least give it a passing thought.

There's one special quirk to many volunteer projects to keep in mind. There's a good chance whatever you're building will have two sets of users. There's the end users, gnerally the people who will be interacting with the organization, and then there's the people in the organization itself who will be responsible for maintaining it. It's absolutely vital that you plan with this second group in mind, otherwise you'll be getting lots of emails saying, "I can't get this to work." Which bringsme nicely to step 3...

_Step 3: Explain Yourself._

Document everything. Add comments to your code. Add ReadMes. Add docs. Have training sessions. Just make sure you explain what you've done and how to use it in great detail. Don't skimp on this. Don't assume that something is so simple that you don't need to explain it. Just do as much as you possibly can. There's a good chance someone with less technical knowledge will be looking through these things, and you want to make sure they can understand it.

There's an easy way to make sure documentation is availalble for large parts of your project -- use open-source tools whenever possible. Many of them already have good documentation, and if not you can contribute and improve your own project while contributing to open source. And I don't need to tell you it saves time to use code someone's already written instead of writing something new from scratch.

It's also probably that no one working at a nonprofit would think about software licensing, so that's up to you. It's worth taking time to add something simple since it's possible the nonprofit will eventually like to share whatever you do with partner organizations. Getting licensing sorted out early in the process means one less potential headache you would have to deal with later.

_Assorted Other Tips_

* It's a good idea under-promise and over-deliver when doing some kind of volunteer project. You're likely to be working with people who don't understand that things like bugs happen and that you can't always control how much you get done in a set period of time. The less they're expecting, the better.

* During your initial communications with a nonprofit, try to make sure you have at least two people you know and can contact with questions. That way if things go crazy on their end it's more likely you can get the answers to any concerns you have in a timely manner.

* Set boundaries. Be upfront with the nonprofit about how many hours you can devote to the project, what to expect, and when you'll be able to work on it/answer their questions. It's also totally fine to explain that you can only answer emails in the evening or on weekends. Don't forget to follow through with these boundaries, though, so no one at the nonprofit expects you to fix something at 3:00 in the afternoon on a Tuesday.

* Don't rule out less technical answers or other, pre-existing options. It may be that there's a new startup that can do exactly what the nonprofit wants to do, or all they really need is a well-designed Excel spreadsheet. Nonprofit employees are more likely to to be able to work with Excel, so maybe get over your misgivings.

* Be careful using Google drive or other such things. Many nonprofits are still stuck in MS-Office-land and employees might use a personal account or one created for work for Google services. Just ask what they'd prefer you use.

_And in Conclusion_

If nothing else remember this -- always keep your project in such a state that someone else could step in and work on it without much difficulty. I'm not naive, I know sometimes there are circumstances that mean you can't finish something. If things are easy to pick up, thouugh, it means you can feel less guilty and the organization can have an easier time picking up where you left off. No matter how much you were able to accomplish, that's the best way to really help a nonprofit in your community.
