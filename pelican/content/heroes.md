Amid all the outcry over the latest Harper Lee book and the discovery that Atticus Finch was actually racist, I had to think of Napoleon. Outwardly the two have nothing in common, but taking a closer look may help us understand how understanding complex individuals can help us understand our society.

It started when I read a recent [article in the Smithsonian Magazine on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/we-better-off-napoleon-never-lost-waterloo-180955298/?no-ist) In it historian Andrew Robers claims that when Napoleon gained power in France for a second time he was more concerned with making progressive reforms in France than European conquest. The nations fighting Napoleon weren't trying to protect the peace, they were more concerned Napoleon's liberal, revolution-inspired ideas would spread to their shores.

So was Napoleon a rampaging, egomaniacal tyrant bent on conquering the civilized world? Maybe he was, but maybe he also helped France to become the model for the modern nation-state with his Civil Code and public works. Why can't he be both? History is full of people with mixed legacies - Julius Caesar, Henry VIII, Thomas Jefferson. They're not heroes or villians, they're simple humans. And humans can be complicated.

In much the same way, it's possible, even logical, that an attorney in a small Southern town would perform his professional duties regardless of race but still support segregation. Those who are upset that a hero had been dragged through the mud should probably look at their own beliefs a bit. 

Because when we draw a strict line betwen "good" and "evil" or "white savior" and "horrible racist" it can become harder to understand the complexity of our own world.
